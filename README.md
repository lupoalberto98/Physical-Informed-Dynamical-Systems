# Physical-Informed-Dynamical-Systems
Code for my Msc Thesis, "Tackling dynamical systems with Phsyical Informed Neural Netowrks". We are building an dynamic integrator which change sampling time difference according to the instability regions in a chaotic system and trying to predict Lyapunov exponents with PINNs. Benchmark models are Lorenz63, Rossel and Lorenz96. Next step will be using PINNs to fit real data with higher dimensional models.
